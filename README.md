# Friendly 🧠

An interactive developer tool designed to guide you through the decision process of choosing the correct React hook. Built to teach mental models, not just syntax.

## 🚀 Overview

Friendly asks you a series of guided questions about your code's intent (data, effects, performance) and navigates a decision tree to recommend the mathematically correct hook for your situation.

It provides:
- Correct mental models (e.g., "useRef is an escape hatch").
- "Use When" vs "Avoid When" heuristics.
- Production-ready code snippets.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React (Vite)
- **State Management:** `useReducer` (Finite State Machine pattern)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Architecture:** Data-Driven Decision Tree
- **No Backend, No Authentication, No APIs.**
